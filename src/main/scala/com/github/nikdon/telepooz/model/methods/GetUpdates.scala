/**
  * Use this method to receive incoming updates using long polling (wiki). An Array of Update objects is returned.
  *
  * @param offset   Identifier of the first update to be returned. Must be greater by one than the highest among
  *                 the identifiers of previously received updates. By default, updates starting with the earliest
  *                 unconfirmed update are returned. An update is considered confirmed as soon as getUpdates is
  *                 called with an offset higher than its update_id. The negative offset can be specified to retrieve
  *                 updates starting from -offset update from the end of the updates queue. All previous updates
  *                 will forgotten.
  * @param limit    Limits the number of updates to be retrieved. Values between 1â€”100 are accepted. Defaults to 100.
  * @param timeout  Timeout in seconds for long polling. Defaults to 0, i.e. usual short polling
